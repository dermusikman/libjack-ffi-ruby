Introduction
============

This fork intends to 

1. add full MIDI functionality
2. provide total JACK stack availability

The primary goal is compatibility with [UniMIDI](https://github.com/arirusso/unimidi), but Ruby would be a great tool for tinkering with sound and MIDI both!

I am modeling this after Ari Russo's [ffi-coremidi](https://github.com/arirusso/ffi-coremidi), as it works, and is inherently compatible with UniMIDI.

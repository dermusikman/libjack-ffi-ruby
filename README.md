Introduction
============

This fork intends to add full MIDI functionality.

The end-goal is compatibility with [UniMIDI](https://github.com/arirusso/unimidi), but the greater goal (which is not that important to me, personally, is total JACK stack availability.

Ruby would be a great tool for tinkering with sound and MIDI.

I am modeling this after Ari Russo's ffi-coremidi, as it works.
